# Job Board Application #

There are more IT jobs out there than people are available. It would be great if we have the
possibility to offer a platform where users can easily post new jobs offer (of course ruby and rails
jobs) to get enough people for your company.

This is the outline scenario - it's a real world example, so when your chef ask you if you know how
to create such piece of software raise your hand and say that you have spme bleeding-edge technology
which fits perfect for the job.

The outline is easy, and as a developer you have implementation details with many good and cool
features in your mind. But step back from the thoughts to get started with switching your fingertips
on the keyboard. Clear your mind and take a piece of paper (or your favorite paint program) and
outline a scheme of what you want to create. Make small steps, test your code, integrate your code
often, and deploy your code. Don't worry, I will show you how you to create a healthy and motivating
work flow with many neat and small hints.  Sounds difficult in your ears? Well, actually it is, but
just start, and don't let your mind gets filled with fears and issues to hinder your daily progress.
