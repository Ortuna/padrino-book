# To do #

- ask leanpub guys what size should be taken, when using omnigraffle - it only has 'dots per inch'
- change the ppi for the images to 400 and test the mobile versions
- add pictures of git tools
- investigate how to make references to other sections in markdown (see 02 section)
- create class diagrams for modeling parts


# Done #

nothing so far
