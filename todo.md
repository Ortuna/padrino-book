# To do #

- ask leanpub guys what size should be taken, when using omnigraffle - it only has 'dots per inch'
- change the ppi for the images to 400 and test the mobile versions
- add pictures of git tools
- investigate how to make references to other sections in markdown (see 02 section)
- create class diagrams for modeling parts
- shortcut haml - for what does it stands? (chapter 2)
- ask leanpub-guys how to make references to other sections in other files in markdown
- add 'Special thank you page' in the book to thank all the guys who made this project possible
- add @ManuelKiesling on the special thanks page for showing me leanpub and retweeting my posts
  about my daily progress, and many other hints in writing a book
