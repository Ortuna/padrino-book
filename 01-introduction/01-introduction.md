Why another book about how to develop an application in Rails? But hold, this book should give you a
basic introduction how to develop a web application with
[padrino](http://www.padrinorb.com/). Padrino is a "The Elgant Ruby Web Framework". Is is
based on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and has some really nice features which makes it
easier to create web application with less code and more fun than to with it's father Rails

the stencial extensions by [konigi](http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils "konigi")
for writing wireframes
