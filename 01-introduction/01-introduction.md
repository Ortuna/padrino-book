# Introduction #

Why another book about how to develop an application in Rails? But hold, this book should give you a
basic introduction how to develop a web application with [padrino](http://www.padrinorb.com/).
Padrino is a "The Elgant Ruby Web Framework". Is is based on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and
has some really nice features which makes it easier to create web application with less code and
more fun than to with it's father Rails


## Planning the application ##

On the following image you can image you can see the basic image of our application[^omnigraffle]:

![Figure 1-1. Start page of the application](images/01-introduction/application_overview.jpg)

[^omnigraffle]: You can use a classical stencil and paper to create mockups. But my handwriting is
so bad that I used [Omnigraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/ "Omnigraffle") with
the stencil extensions by [konigi](http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils "konigi")
for writing wireframes.


## Your environment ##

Nowadays there are a bunch of IDEs out there: [RubyMine by JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/
"RubyMine") (commercial) [Aptana RadRails](http://www.aptana.com/products/radrails "Aptana
RadRails") (free).  Or you can switch to some text editors [Textmate](http://macromates.com/
"Textmate") (commercial for Mac only), and [vim](http://www.vim.org/ "vim"), which just run on every
server and under every terminal.

They all have there strength and weak sides. You have to experiment with them and take what fits
your needs. Due to the fact that I will do a bunch of really great command-line, I prefer to use a
"classical" **text editor** (see my [vim-settings repository on
github](https://github.com/matthias-guenther/vim-settings "vim-settings repository on github") if
you want to see which tool I use every day). In the end you have to decide what you want to take.
The main goal is that you are comfortable with it because you will mostly spend a lot of time with
it.
